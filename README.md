# About me
Hello Welcome to my github I am glad you are here.
My strengths lie in research, self-directed planning, curiosity, and not feeling overwhelmed by reading or creating the documentation. 
I have a generalist approach to seeking knowledge and can patiently find answers, either through reading software documentation or the code itself or by asking if I know whom to ask. 
If there are clear instructions exist, I follow them, if not, Iâ€™m resourceful enough to improvise, learn through trials and errors, and document the process for future use.
