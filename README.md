# About me
Hello, Welcome to my GitHub. I am glad you are here.
My strengths lie in research, self-directed planning, curiosity, and not feeling overwhelmed by reading or creating the documentation. 
I have a generalist approach to seeking knowledge and patiently find answers, either through reading software documentation or the code itself or by asking if I know whom to ask. 
If there are clear instructions exist, I follow them, if not, Iâ€™m resourceful enough to improvise, learn through trial and error, and document the process for future use.
